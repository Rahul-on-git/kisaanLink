This is an end to end solution for farmers to sell their produce and buyers to buy the same with no
middlemen in the process. The solution achieves Cost effectiveness and helps to deliver most fresh
vegetables and fruits to the buyer. There is also the most optimal use of transportation. The
transportation of the orders to the buyer is based on the concept of truck pooling which involves
dynamic allotment of produce of farmers to trucks based on existing loads alloted for a truck and the
destination of the truck. Also, more transparency is achieved by allowing the farmers and the buyers
to track the orders live in trucks with their number plates and live location. The buyers with more
frequent orders are incentivized and also farmers which sell their produce on a daily basis are given
cost cuts in transport commission.

# It is based on a REST API and it is built using MERN as the techstack.
